# Data Science Projects

This repository contains some projects I worked on when first learning data science and machine learning. These notebooks are provided here for the sake of **knowledge sharing**. Please feel free to use any of the included projects as inspiration or for guidance if you are starting out as a Data Scientist or ML Engineer!

## Contributing
If you are a fellow data scientist or machine learning engineer who is interested in sharing their work for others to use and learn from, please Fork the repository and open a Pull Request. All projects should be self-contained and placed within a uniquely named folder within the `projects` folder.
### Guidelines
- Notebooks should be fully self-contained and have full outputs. In other words, readers should be able to read through the notebook and understand your work without needing to run the code 
- Code should be well organized and documented
- To the extent possible, data should be downloaded programmatically (e.g. using public URLs), and all projects must use publicly accessible and free data
